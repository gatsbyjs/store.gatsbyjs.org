# Gatsby Store

This is the Gatsby store, where we make swag, stickers, and other Gatsby goodies available to contributors and Gatsby enthusiasts. ðŸ’ªðŸ’œ

## Technical Overview

This store is built with data from:

- [Shopify](https://shopify.com)
- The [Shopify JavaScript Buy SDK](https://shopify.github.io/js-buy-sdk/)
- [Auth0](https://auth0.com/)

Weâ€™re using [Gatsby V2](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby) and [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/) to get the data on screen.

The store is statically rendered using the Shopify source plugin, and the maintainer dashboard is a dynamic app (e.g. client-only routes) protected by Auth0.

## Free Swag for Contributors

If you're a contributor to Gatsby, that means you can get one free item from our store! Log in using your GitHub account and we'll give you a discount code good for a t-shirt or socks.

## Cheap Swag for All

We sell our swag at pretty close to cost (we round for easy math) and we donâ€™t charge shipping fees. Grab a t-shirt or socks and show everyone your favorite blazing fast framework!
