## Technical Overview

This store is built with data from:

- [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/)
- The [Shopify JavaScript Buy SDK](https://shopify.github.io/js-buy-sdk/)
- [Auth0](https://auth0.com/)

Weâ€™re using [Gatsby V2](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby) and [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/) to get the data on screen.

The store is statically rendered using the Shopify source plugin, and the maintainer dashboard is a dynamic app (e.g. client-only routes) protected by Auth0.

## Free Swag for Contributors

If you're a contributor to Gatsby, that means you can get one free item from our store! Log in using your GitHub account and we'll give you a discount code good for a t-shirt or socks. With five or more contributions, You can claim your **level two** swag!

See [the docs for claiming contributor swag](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/contributing/contributor-swag/) for additional details.

## Cheap Swag for All

We sell our swag at pretty close to cost (we round for easy math) and we donâ€™t charge shipping fees. Grab a t-shirt or socks and show everyone your favorite blazing fast framework!

  <summary><strong>I wanted to order something but it's out. How long will it take before it's back in stock?</strong></summary>

&nbsp; <!-- leave this here to avoid smashing the text against the summary -->

Some of the swag has been selling like hotcakes (only less tasty and providing a bit more coverage). Once an item is out, it takes us about 3 weeks for it to get back in stock.

<details>
  <summary><strong>The delivery service is telling me I need to pay additional fees to get my order. I thought Gatsby covered shipping costs. What gives?</strong></summary>

&nbsp; <!-- leave this here to avoid smashing the text against the summary -->

On some international orders, customs will add additional taxes, duties, and other fees. This is unpredictable, and we have no way of knowing if or when it will happen, or how much it will be. If this happens to you, there is, unfortunately, nothing else Gatsby can do. You are responsible for paying any additional fees imposed as part of the customs process. Thanks for your understanding!
