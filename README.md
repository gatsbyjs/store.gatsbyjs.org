# Gatsby Store

This is the Gatsby store, where we make swag, stickers, and other Gatsby goodies available to contributors and Gatsby enthusiasts. ðŸ’ªðŸ’œ

## Technical Overview

This store is built with data from:

- [Shopify](https://shopify.com)
- The [Shopify JavaScript Buy SDK](https://shopify.github.io/js-buy-sdk/)
- [Auth0](https://auth0.com/)

Weâ€™re using [Gatsby V2](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby) and [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/) to get the data on screen.

The store is statically rendered using the Shopify source plugin, and the maintainer dashboard is a dynamic app (e.g. client-only routes) protected by Auth0.

## Free Swag for Contributors

If you're a contributor to Gatsby, that means you can get one free item from our store! Log in using your GitHub account and we'll give you a discount code good for a t-shirt or socks.

See [the docs for claiming contributor swag](https://next.gatsbyjs.org/docs/contributor-swag/) for additional details.

## Cheap Swag for All

We sell our swag at pretty close to cost (we round for easy math) and we donâ€™t charge shipping fees. Grab a t-shirt or socks and show everyone your favorite blazing fast framework!

## Frequently Asked Questions
**Why does it say I'm not eligible when I enter the discount code?**

Try opening the store in an incognito window and then proceed to check out. When checking out, make sure you're using the same email that's listed on your GitHub account.

**Why can't I get the store to authenticate?**

This may be a local storage issue and require you to NOT use the Safari browser to check out

**Why won't my credit card work?**

Please send us a message if you're getting this issue, as that probably means there is something wrong on our end.

**I've been waiting for my package, but it hasn't arrived yet.**

International shipments can take up to 6 weeks to be delivered. Tracking updates may not always show up in real time on your tracking link.. If you still have not received your order at the end of 6 weeks, please let us know and we'll see how we can help!

**I wanted to order something but it's out. How long will it take before it's back in stock?**
Some of the swag has been selling like hotcakes (only less tasty and a providing a bit more coverage). Once an item is out, it takes us about 3 weeks for it to get back in stock.
