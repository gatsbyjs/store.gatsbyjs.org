# Gatsby Store

This is the Gatsby store, where we make swag, stickers, and other Gatsby goodies available to contributors and Gatsby enthusiasts. ðŸ’ªðŸ’œ

## Technical Overview

This store is built with data from:

- [Shopify](https://shopify.com)
- The [Shopify JavaScript Buy SDK](https://shopify.github.io/js-buy-sdk/)
- [Auth0](https://auth0.com/)

Weâ€™re using [Gatsby V2](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby) and [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/) to get the data on screen.

The store is statically rendered using the Shopify source plugin, and the maintainer dashboard is a dynamic app (e.g. client-only routes) protected by Auth0.

## Free Swag for Contributors

If you're a contributor to Gatsby, that means you can get one free item from our store! Log in using your GitHub account and we'll give you a discount code good for a t-shirt or socks.

See [the docs for claiming contributor swag](https://next.gatsbyjs.org/docs/contributor-swag/) for additional details.

## Cheap Swag for All

We sell our swag at pretty close to cost (we round for easy math) and we donâ€™t charge shipping fees. Grab a t-shirt or socks and show everyone your favorite blazing fast framework!

  We _think_ this is a local storage issue, and it only seems to happen in Safari-based browsers. This includes all iOS browsers. Please see [this issue](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/store.gatsbyjs.org/issues/106) for details (or to help us fix it).

  <summary><strong>I wanted to order something but it's out. How long will it take before it's back in stock?</strong></summary>

  &nbsp; <!-- leave this here to avoid smashing the text against the summary -->

  Some of the swag has been selling like hotcakes (only less tasty and a providing a bit more coverage). Once an item is out, it takes us about 3 weeks for it to get back in stock.
